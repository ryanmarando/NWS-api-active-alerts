FINAL PROJECT: 
    WEATHER ALERT SYSTEM

WHAT IT WILL DO:
    User will provide what state and counties they wish to receive active alerts from
    Program will read from api.weather.gov to get the warnings for their state
    Program will either:
        show warnings outputted on their screen and update as they change on a website
        or export warnings in a csv file to be read into Max
    Warnings will change color and icon for type of warning and sort based on importance of warning type
    Saved users will automatically have what areas they want on their list


HOW I WILL DO IT:
    IF WEBSITE: React website that reads in from the API
    IF CSV: Some go or either javascript that outputs it


ON WEBSITE:
    User will enter the state they wish from a drop down then choose counties they want in a checklist
    After entering the state and counties the user wishes to enter, the server will auto refresh every 
    30 seconds to export into a csv and output that data into Max

    

COUNTY LIST:
/*
let countyList = new Set([
  "Sumter",
  "Baldwin",
  "Bibb",

WHAT TO DO:
    Construct a website (outline the look of it)
        map out functionality
        how do people interact with it
    Building layout with html and css
    Start constructing the logic using javascript (file parsers and input fields of files)
    React with components (navigation bar and left menu etc.)
        what data will I pass in
    Create an API to fetch and read in the data from the front end 
    Route and connect to controller to send front end data to backend then manipulate
    Button press make a fetch call that sends to the backend/server/api can grab that data

    Either have everything combined together or create another app that is entirely server/api code
    Create separate folder for backend

    Once have route then try to fetch/post from frontend in javascript
    post the states and counties from the user and read in that from the backend which exports to a csv

STILL NEED TO:
    put working copy on a backend server that's always up
    put website onto Vercel
    create a user prompt saying that it exported 
    just make it look pretty
