FINAL PROJECT: 
    WEATHER ALERT SYSTEM

WHAT IT WILL DO:
    User will provide what state and counties they wish to receive active alerts from
    Program will read from api.weather.gov to get the warnings for their state
    Program will either:
        show warnings outputted on their screen and update as they change on a website
        or export warnings in a csv file to be read into Max
    Warnings will change color and icon for type of warning and sort based on importance of warning type
    Saved users will automatically have what areas they want on their list


HOW I WILL DO IT:
    IF WEBSITE: React website that reads in from the API
    IF CSV: Some go or either javascript that outputs it
